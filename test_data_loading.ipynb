The youngest on the list is aged 19, four years younger than the youngest last \\nyear.  \\nCommenting on the launch,  Yatin Shah, Co -Founder & Joint CEO, IIFL Wealth, said,  “IIFL Wealth Hurun \\nIndia Rich List 2022, is a comprehensive overview of a plethora of factors that have significantly \\ncontributed to the rising wealth of India  and we are proud to associate with the same . Despite the slump \\nin the economy owing to geo -political challenges, volatility in global financia l markets, and sharp spike in \\noil prices, India has successfully made an impression on the world’s economy/wealth  map. \\nPharmaceuticals, chemical & petrochemicals, IT, and financial services amongst others are some of the \\nkey sectors substantially contribut ing to wealth creation. It is exhilarating to see the entrepreneurial \\necosystem of India contribute a significant amount to this list with the rising number of women \\nentrepreneurs and uptick in self -made entrepreneurs. There are 65 founders of 37 unicorns along with 14 \\nprofessional managers who have emerged as the cornerstone of wealth creation this time in the list. ” \\n \\nCommenting on the launch , Anirudha Taparia, Joint CEO, IIFL Wealth, said,  “While COVID -19 pandemic \\nreckoned the global economy, India is on the path of recovery owing to the collaborative efforts of the \\npolicymakers, the RBI, government ’s focus on capital spending, acceleration in digitization , and start of \\nthe private capex cycl e. For us, it is encouraging to note that the IIFL Wealth Hurun India Rich List 2022 \\nhas only grown, mirroring the improved and optimistic sentiments of emerging entrepreneurs and \\nindustry leaders. Gurugram debuted in the top 10 cities producing most numbe r of entrants and we have \\na record addition of 149 new faces to the list from 32 industries and 36 cities. This is yet a reflection of \\nthe scope of growth among emerging sectors as well as beyond -metro cities. This report not only offers \\nan analysis of the  various facets of our nation’s wealth creators but further provides detailed perspective \\non India’s strong fundamentals and quality of human capital. As part of our long -standing association with \\nHurun India Rich List, we believe that in the current chall enging global macroeco nomic  scenario, India is \\na beacon of hope and it will continue to attract flows and long -term foreign investment. ” \\n \\nCommenting on the launch, Anas Rahman Junaid, MD and Chief Researcher, Hurun India , said, “The' metadata={'source': 'pdf_datas\\\\IIFL Wealth Hurun India Rich List 2022- Media Release.pdf', 'page': 1}\n",

      "page_content='149 individuals entered the IIFL We alth Hurun India Rich list of 1,103 who cumulatively have a wealth of \\nINR 100 lakh crore. India also gave a new number two, Gautam Adani, to the Hurun Global Rich List.”  \\n“The unprecedented wealth creation in the past five years in India, when other countri es are stalling and \\nare in a recessionary mode, reaffirms India as the ‘engine of growth ’ for the global economy. Remember, \\nthe new additions to IIFL Wealth Hurun India Rich List have occurred at a time when valuations are at a \\nlow, both in the listed and privately held companies. The number of entrants to the list has increased by \\n60% in the past five years. India is best -positioned to capitalize on robust domestic demand, a stable \\npolitical landscape, favourable demographics, and a sustainable external de bt. The next 25 years belong \\nto India and as the Prime Minister proclaimed; i t is Amrit Kaal for the country.”  \\n“From an Indian wealth creation perspective, 2022 will be remembered for Adani’s meteoric rise. Briskly \\nexpanding his commodity trading company i nto a coal –to–port -to-energy conglomerate, he is the only \\nIndian to have built not one, but seven companies with a market cap of one lakh crore. The cumulative \\nwealth growth of the IIFL Wealth Hurun India Rich List 2022 excluding Adani is only 2.67%, compa red to \\nthe overall 9%.”  \\n“In 2012, Adani’s wealth was hardly one -sixth of Ambani’s wealth and no one could imagine that he would \\novertake Ambani to become the richest man in India in ten years. This is a reflection of the dynamism and \\nstructural transformat ion of the Indian economy. The success of a first -generation entrepreneur like Adani \\nexemplifies the potential for growth in an economy that is witnessing economies of scale in many \\nunexploited sectors and the paradigm shift in the generation of new wealth .” \\n“Be it Tata or Birla, India has just nurtured some of the most respected family business houses in the \\nworld. Almost 60% of the IIFL Wealth Hurun India Rich List is going to witness intergenerational wealth \\ntransfer in the next 10 years. The young leade rs of the family, supported by some of the brightest \\nprofessional managers and investors, will turbocharge wealth creation in family businesses.”  \\n“What makes the Indian wealth creation story truly inspirational is that 67% of the list is self -made, up \\nfrom  54% five years ago. Also, 79% of the new faces this year are self -made as well. The wealth creation \\nengine of first -generation entrepreneurs and professional managers is on full throttle and is an important \\ndriver for India’s GDP to swiftly reach US$5 tri llion mark.”  \\n“India’s bench strength or the pipeline of entrepreneurs can be understood best from the start -up \\necosystem, which is the third largest in the world with more than 80,000 start -ups. It has the third -highest \\nnumber of Unicorns and Gazelles in t he world. IIFL Wealth Hurun India Rich List 2022 has 100 entrants \\nfrom 59 start -ups and going forward, the share of start -ups is likely to increase manifold. This has resulted \\nin more young entrepreneurs entering the IIFL Wealth Hurun India Rich List. For instance, the youngest \\nten years ago was 37, last year was 23 and this year is 19.”  \\n“The IPOs of some of the high -profile startups realigned the valuation spread between institutional and \\nretail investors. Having said the aforementioned, we believe the sta rtup wealth creation will continue, \\nalthough with “new rules in the game”.  \\n“Wealth creation has also become more decentralis ed and dispersed. Over the last decade, the number \\nof Indian cities in the rich list jumped to 82, up from 10. At this rate, I expec t to see each of the \\ngovernment’s planned 100 smart cities to have a rich lister within five years.”  IFL\\nWEALTHRICHEST' metadata={'source': 'pdf_datas\\\\IIFL Wealth Hurun India Rich List 2022- Media Release.pdf', 'page': 2}\n",
      "page_content=\"“The list has become more ‘inclusive’. The number of women in the list is 55 this year, up from 13 ten \\nyears ago.”  \\n“On the back of strengthening US Dollar , the number of dollar billionaires has come down by 16 to 221. If \\ncalculated at last year’s exchange rate, the number of dollar billionaires would have increased by 3 to \\n241.”  \\n“Post -pandemic, some of the COVID winners such as generic pharma, diagnostics , and Software & Services \\nfaced headwinds. While pharma and diagnostics dropped mainly on account of subdued demand post \\nCOVID , Software & Services industry has taken a beating due to fears of a recession in the developed \\nmarkets that house most of the outso urcing clients.”  \\n“Hospitality, Real Estate and Textile registered a solid comeback on the back of post -COVID  demand surge. \\nFor instance, the occupancy and average room rate have moved higher than the pre -pandemic level and \\nthe industry is estimated to remain buoyant on pent -up demand. India’s super wealth creation stories are \\nbroad -based and not driven by any single sector. For instance, the Top 10 in the IIFL Wealth Hurun India \\nRich List 2022 come from diverse sectors, Gautam Adani  - the r ichest , has interests in power, port, \\nrenewables and energy. Mukesh Ambani, who is in the second rank is in telecom and petrochemicals. \\nCyrus Poonawalla, who is at the third spot is the vaccine king of the world. Then there are pharma, retail, \\nand financia l services in the top 10. These entrepreneurs are the global leaders in their respective sectors.”  \\n“The resilience of India Inc. during global chaos can be best illustrated through a comparison of the indices. \\nThe broader NIFTY has held its own and perform ed better than its global peers in the twelve months to \\nSeptember 8, 2022. The index has only dropped around 6% when compared to NASDAQ's 23% and \\nNIKKEI's 29%. The resilience of Indian companies, the future potential , and the new shoots suggest a \\ngolden fu ture for the nation”  \\n“UPI is a phenomenal success. India has the highest fintech adoption rate and the fastest growing fintech \\nmarket in the world. India has 16 fintech unicorns and 17 entrants in the IIFL Wealth Hurun India Rich List \\n2022. Good regulation  and a huge market - 80 million Indians made their first digital transaction after \\n2020 and 190 million are still unbanked  - makes it the breeding ground for new wealth creation.”  \\n“Likewise, the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) is going to be a gam e-changer in India. ONDC \\nwill democratize the buyer -seller platform and save millions with the digitization of the supply chain. \\nSMEs, MSMEs, D2C brands and even Kirana shops can join the platform to extend their reach. I expect \\ngovernment’s ONDC initiativ e to be  a moonshot for accelerated wealth creation for entrepreneurs from \\nretail, logistics , and tech stack that are built on/ for ONDC.”  \\n“EV is another ecosystem that has the potential to contribute new entrants to IIFL Wealth Hurun India \\nRich List. For i nstance, in Hurun China Rich List 2021, the greatest number of entrants hailed from the EV \\nsector. Currently, the only entrants from the EV ecosystem in the list are the founders of Ola Electric and \\nRevolt (RattanIndia Enterprises). If India catches up wit h even 50% of China in terms of EV adoption, there \\nwould be dozens of entrants from the sector in the IIFL Wealth Hurun India Rich List.  \\n“IIFL Wealth Hurun India Rich List tells the story of India’s economy, its current state and future trend by \\nlisting ou t the most successful entrepreneurs in India. The list chronicles the wealth creation story of \\nyoung entrepreneurs, professional managers and business leaders who focus on value creation. I believe \\nthe India story is the most promising wealth creation stor y currently.
